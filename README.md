# Fonio - *a scholarly dissertations editor allowing to build standalone HTML webpages*

Fonio is a collaborative writing software aimed at building rich digital scholarly dissertations using the architecture of websites to structure arguments and the possibility to harness the richness of your work by featuring bibliographic references, images, tables, videos, and interactive elements.

Fonio puts an emphasis on documentation, allowing you to describe all the resources gathered during your inquiry in a rich and homogeneous way (date, source, author, ...). It also allows you to build an augmented glossary in order to define key terms and browse them in an interactive way.

Besides, the application is aimed at allowing to work extensively on the information design of your dissertation: choose a way to organize the reading experience of your readers, and customize the visual identity of your work in a meaningful way.

Fonio is collaborative and allows several writers to work simultaneously on contents, design and documentation. According to this collaborative state of mind, works in progress are readable by the whole classroom, but their edition is restricted to your team.

Each "classroom" corresponds to a specific course and exists during a limited period of time. All works are be saved and privately archived after the semester is finished, but the application also allows students to download their work at anytime to backup it or to publish it online in a clean and easy way.

Fonio is part of the ``quinoa`` project family, a suite of digital storytelling tools tailored for the [FORCCAST](http://controverses.org/) pedagogical program and [m√©dialab sciences po](http://www.medialab.sciences-po.fr/) scientific activities.

It works with the [quinoa-server](https://github.com/medialab/quinoa-server) application which provides a server to store stories and handle collaborative edition.
