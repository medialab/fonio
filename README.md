# Fonio - *a scholarly dissertations editor allowing to build standalone HTML webpages*

Fonio is a collaborative writing software aimed at building rich digital scholarly dissertations, using the architecture of websites to structure arguments, and the possibility to feature an extensible array of resources such as bibliographic references, images, tables, videos, and interactive elements.

Fonio puts an emphasis on documentation, allowing writers to describe all the resources gathered during their inquiry in a rich and homogeneous way (date, source, author, ...). It also allows them to build an augmented glossary in order to define key terms and browse them in an interactive way.

Besides, the application is aimed at allowing to work extensively on the information design of a dissertation: one can choose a way to organize the reading experience of their readers, and customize the visual identity of their work in a meaningful way.

Fonio is collaborative and allows several writers to work simultaneously on contents, design and documentation. According to this collaborative state of mind, works in progress are readable by the whole classroom, but their edition is restricted to each team.

Each "classroom" corresponds to a specific course and exists during a limited period of time. All works are saved and privately archived after the semester is finished, but the application also allows writers to download their work at anytime to backup it or to publish it online in a clean and easy way.

Fonio is part of the ``quinoa`` project family, a suite of digital storytelling tools tailored for the [FORCCAST](http://controverses.org/) pedagogical program and [m√©dialab sciences po](http://www.medialab.sciences-po.fr/) scientific activities.

It works with the [quinoa-server](https://github.com/medialab/quinoa-server) application which provides a server to store stories and handles collaborative edition through websockets.

# Requirements

* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

# Installation

Nota bene: you have to install both fonio (the client/visual interface) and [quinoa-server](https://github.com/medialab/quinoa-server) (the server/data management application) to be able to run this application.

Prerequisites :

* install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* learn to use [macos terminal](https://macpaw.com/fr/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac), [windows command line](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm) or [linux command line](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners#0) depending on your operating system

To install `quinoa-server`, open your terminal/command line tool and run the following commands in a directory of your choice :

```
git clone https://github.com/medialab/quinoa-server
cd quinoa-server
npm install
cp config/sample.json config/default.json
```

Then edit the ``config/default.json`` file with your own settings.


Then, to install `fonio`, open your terminal/command line tool and run the following commands in a directory of your choice :

```
git clone https://github.com/medialab/fonio
cd fonio
npm install
cp config/sample.json config/default.json
```

Then edit the ``config/default.json`` file with your own settings.


# Development

In both fonio and quinoa-server folders, run in two different terminal/command line tabs :

```
npm run dev
```

Fonio application is then available locally at the following address: [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)

Fonio is compatible with the [Redux Devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) browser extension for an optimal developer experience.

# Deployment

For matters of deploying fonio to an online/"production" version, Fonio is supposed to run in a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) infrastructure.

Please look at the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/medialab/quinoa-server/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present on [quinoa-server](https://github.com/medialab/quinoa-server) repository for that matter.
